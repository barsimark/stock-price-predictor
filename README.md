# Stock price prediction

### Aim of the project and dataset

The aim of this project is to use deep learning to predict future prices of stocks. Nvidia and QQQ (US-based tech index) stock prices between January 2015 and February 2022 are used as an example.

The datasets are publicly available at MarketWatch in a downloadable .csv format in yearly chanks.

### Plans for the future

- Improve the basic model to get more accurate results
- Add new model with Nvidia and QQQ as inputs, and Nvidia prediction as output
- Compare the results of each model and determine the best
- Reduce or eliminate outliers with using something like moving average
- Give predictions for the future and use it in real trading
